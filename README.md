# PSyn [WIP]
The library aims to solve the task of Morphological (re)inflection using program synthesis techniques. It is being built as a part of my Bachelors Thesis Project under the supervision of Prof. Pawan Goyal from Dept. of Computer Science, IIT Kharagpur. I am working in a team of two with Athitya Kumar on this project.

Currently, an Ensemble Classifier of Decision Trees has been built as the baseline system. It generates correct inflections with an accuracy of **52.54%**.

The documentation for the module will be added soon.

# To do list:
 * Library todos
   * [TODO](PSyn/TODO.md)
 * System todos:
   * Setup GPU pipeline in the server
