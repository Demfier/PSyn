Current tasks:
*  [x] Do the supervised task of guessing operations given a word, basically make a classifier.
        Map operation matrix to co-occurance matrix using (all done):
        1. Random Forest
        2. Multinomial Logistic Regression
        3. Decision Tree
*  [ ] Combine the different meta matrix generators to one (Output a single, combine meta matrix (instead of 3 currently))
*  [ ] Remove obsolete function from `matrix_functions` and `brain` modules
*  [ ] Look for submodule fixes within the code
*  [ ] Fix the noun-specific code
*  [ ] Make automated parallel pipeline
*  [ ] Take out the repeated task into one function
*  [ ] Use classes to modularize the code (*High Priority*)
*  [ ] Add code documentation
*  [ ] Fix operation dictionary(*Urgent*)
*  [ ] Complete this list
